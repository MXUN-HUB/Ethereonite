# Ethereonite

Bringing block chain to everyone

## Social Problem

Ever since the COVID-19 Pandemic happened, the Global economics have been suffering.  Alot of people lost their job and businesses. Moreover,  ever since the 2007-08 economic crisis the banking system had never fully recovered and their policies have gone stale over the past decade. Unable to accomidate the needs of the people.

## Our Idea


1. A web portal where you can make crypto transactions          
2. The payment is universal and on the blockcahin. 
3. Crowd sourcing where people  can contribute and pay in crypto
4. A fundraiser which will donate money towards covid help.
5. We will liquedate the crypto which can straight up generate cash and help the families in need.


## Project Scope
### User-Friendly
We will have a very minimalist easy to use ui which will make the transactions like a breeze and without any problem.
### Revolutionize
This will make the whole concept of using crypto and blockchain easy to use for new-comers and veterans alike and improve the banking sector as a whole.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
